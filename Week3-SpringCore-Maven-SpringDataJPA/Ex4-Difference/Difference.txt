1. Java Persistence API (JPA)
What it is: A specification (JSR 338) for persisting, retrieving, and managing data from Java objects to a database.
Key point: It’s just a set of interfaces and annotations — no actual database interaction code inside it.
Example providers: Hibernate, EclipseLink, OpenJPA.
Analogy: JPA is like a blueprint for building a house. It defines what a “door” and “window” should be but doesn’t build them.

2. Hibernate
What it is: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that implements JPA.
Role: Maps Java objects to database tables and handles SQL generation, caching, lazy loading, etc.
Extra: Hibernate existed before JPA; JPA later standardized many concepts Hibernate already had.
Analogy: Hibernate is the construction company that follows the JPA blueprint to actually build the house.

3. Spring Data JPA
What it is: A Spring framework module that sits on top of JPA (and indirectly Hibernate) to reduce boilerplate code.
Role:
Eliminates manual DAO code.
Automatically provides CRUD operations.
Supports custom query methods via method names or @Query.
Handles transaction management automatically.
Extra: Spring Data JPA does not implement JPA itself — it relies on a JPA provider like Hibernate.
Analogy: Spring Data JPA is the real estate agent who gives you a fully ready-to-use house without you worrying about construction details.
