Time Complexity:
This recursion makes one call per year → O(n) time complexity.

Space complexity is also O(n) because of the call stack.

Optimization – Avoid Excessive Computation:
Memoization: Store results for given inputs so you don’t recompute them.
Convert to Iterative:
Iteration avoids the call stack overhead.
Same logic, but runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.
