Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself until a base condition is met.
It’s useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type.

Example: Predicting financial growth
If you know the value in year n and the growth rate,
You can get year n+1 as:
futureValue=currentValue×(1+growthRate)
Then repeat for the required years.

Pros:
Simplifies code for problems with repeated similar steps.

Cons:
Can be slow if not optimized (due to repeated calculations).
Risk of stack overflow for deep recursion.
