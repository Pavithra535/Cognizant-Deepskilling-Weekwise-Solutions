Recommendation for E-commerce:

For small product lists or lists that change very often → Linear Search may be simpler.
For large datasets where search speed is critical and updates are less frequent → Binary Search is far more efficient.
In production, e-commerce platforms often use advanced search indexing (e.g., B-Trees, Tries, or ElasticSearch) for even faster results.
